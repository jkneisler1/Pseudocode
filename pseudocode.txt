1. Find the average score

IPO
===
Input		Process			Output
==============================================
number

		calculate sum
		update number
		calculate average

					print avarage
Pseudocode
==========
DECLARE Integer counter
DECLARE Real	number
DECLARE	Real	sum
DECLARE Real	average

SET counter = 0
SET sum = 0 
SET average = 0
DOWHILE counter <= 10
	PROMPT the user for a number
	GET number
	UPDATE sum: sum = sum + number
	UPDATE counter: counter = counter + 1
END

CALCULATE average: avarage = sum / counter
DISPLAY avarage: print average


2. How much water runs off the roof
===================================
Input		Process			Output
==============================================
length_of_roof in feet
width_of_roof in feet
amount_of_rain in inches

		Convert length_of_roof to inches
		Convert width_of_roof to inches
		Multiply the length_of_roof by width_of_roof by the inches of rain

					Total rainfall on the roof

Pseudocode
==========
DECLARE Integer length_of_roof_ft
DECLARE Integer width_of_roof_ft
DECLARE Integer length_of_roof_in
DECLARE Integer width_of_roof_in
DECLARE Integer amount_of_rain_in
DECLARE Real total_rain
DECLARE CONSTANT Integer c_inches_to_gallons = 231

PROMPT What is the length of the roof in feet?
GET Integer length_of_roof_ft
PROMPT What is the width of the roof in feet?
GET Integer width_of_roof_ft
PROMPT How much rain fell on the roof in inches?
GET amount_of_rain_in

CALCULATE length_of_roof_in = length_of_roof_ft * 12
CALCULATE width_of_roof_in = width_of_roof_ft * 12
CALCULATE total_rain = length_of_roof_in * width_of_roof_in * amount_of_rain_in * c_inches_to_gallons
DISPLAY "Total gallons of rain on the roof: " & total_rain
